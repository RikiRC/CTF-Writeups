# Chaplin's PR Nightmare - 4
# Description:
Charlie left another flag on his company's website. Maybe you have to reach out to him???

The inner content of this flag begins with "w3"

# Solution:
- Go to the Contact page on Charlie's page - https://www.charliechaplin.dev/contact
- In "If you know, who are you trying to contact?" there is additional hint - Authors Note (Because Yall Deserve to learn): You can enumerate email lists from contact forms sometimes in a way functionally identical to this. Its not common but I've seen it more than once.
- Now you can check the source of contact form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpLDShOWwi3gQb12RfViHuVZR-__L5p8vIAQVQ6eczQULN3Q/viewform?embedded=true - the flag is in form's script
