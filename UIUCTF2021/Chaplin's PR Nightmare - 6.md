# Solution:
- Go to the - https://www.charliechaplin.dev/contact - on the very bottom of the page there is a hint - You can also find us on Linkedin, but you will have to search for us I forget what our name is, either like "Charlie Chaplin Coding or Development" or "C3D" something like that.
- Look for the C3D group - https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13984825/
- Go to the profile of the owner - https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-chaplin-dev/
- In experience there is another hint - I ran a event called "Top Hat Development Night". It was very cool, you can find it on linkedin still search it up
- Search for the event called "Top Hat Development Night" - https://www.linkedin.com/events/6822753659445743616/ - the flag is in the description
